# Android-Web-Crawler-with-threading
An android web crawler working on Jsoup's library with multi threading.

The crawled files are saved inside an SQLite database. 

A web crawler (also known as a web spider or web robot) is a program or automated script which browses the World Wide Web in a methodical, automated manner.
Web crawlers are mainly used to create a copy of all the visited pages for later processing by a search engine, that will index the downloaded pages to provide fast searches.

Crawlers can also be used for automating maintenance tasks on a Web site, such as checking links or validating HTML code.

**NOTE** Not all files have been uploaded, just enough for the project to be recreated (Because of Github issues).
